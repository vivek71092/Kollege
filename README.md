## Database Schema

The database schema defines the structure for storing all application data. Key tables include:

  * `Users`: Stores user accounts (students, teachers, admins) and credentials.
  * `Courses`: Represents academic programs (e.g., "Computer Science").
  * `Subjects`: Represents individual classes within a course (e.g., "Web Development").
  * `Enrollments`: Links students to the subjects they are taking.
  * `Assignments`: Defines tasks given to students.
  * `Submissions`: Stores student work submitted for assignments.
  * `Notes`: Stores lecture notes and materials uploaded by teachers.
  * `Attendance`: Records student presence for classes.
  * `Marks`: Stores aggregate marks (midterm, final, total, grade) for students per subject.
  * `Settings`: Stores key-value pairs for system configuration.
  * `Messages`, `Notifications`, `AuditLogs`, `ClassSchedule`...

For the complete schema, refer to the `/migrations/create_tables.sql` file.

-----

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Kollege LMS project.

### Prerequisites

  * Web Server (Apache or Nginx recommended)
  * PHP 7.4 or higher (with PDO, mbstring, and json extensions enabled)
  * MySQL 5.7 or higher
  * Composer (Recommended, especially if using `.env` file)
  * Web Browser

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone/Download:**

      * Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url> kollege-lms`
      * OR Download the project ZIP file and extract it.
      * Place the project files in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs`, `www`) or a designated virtual host directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies (if using Composer):**

      * Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
      * Run: `composer install`
      * *Note: If you are not using `.env` files or other Composer packages, this step can be skipped.*

3.  **Database Setup:**

      * Create a new MySQL database (e.g., `if0_40212246_kollege` or `kollege_lms`).
      * Import the database structure using a MySQL client (like phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or the command line):
        ```bash
        mysql -u <your_db_username> -p <your_database_name> < migrations/create_tables.sql
        ```
      * (Optional) Import sample data:
        ```bash
        mysql -u <your_db_username> -p <your_database_name> < migrations/seed_data.sql
        ```

### Configuration (.env Recommended)

This is the **recommended** method for handling configuration, especially credentials.

1.  **Create `.env` File:** Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` in the project root:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  **Edit `.env`:** Open the `.env` file and update the following variables with your specific environment details:
      * `DB_HOST`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`
      * `BASE_URL` (Crucial\! Include the trailing slash, e.g., `http://localhost/kollege-lms/` or `https://kollege.ct.ws/`)
      * `ENVIRONMENT` (`development` or `production`)
      * Update SMTP settings if you plan to use email features.
3.  **Modify `config.php`:** Ensure your `config.php` is set up to load the `.env` file using a library like `vlucas/phpdotenv` (installed via Composer). Add this near the top of `config.php`:
    ```php
    // Load Composer's autoloader
    require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // Adjust path if needed

    // Load .env file
    try {
        $dotenv = Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__);
        $dotenv->load();
        $dotenv->required(['DB_HOST', 'DB_NAME', 'DB_USERNAME', 'DB_PASSWORD', 'BASE_URL', 'ENVIRONMENT']); // Ensure essential variables are set
    } catch (\Dotenv\Exception\InvalidPathException $e) {
        die("Could not find the .env file. Please copy .env.example to .env and configure it.");
    } catch (\Dotenv\Exception\ValidationException $e) {
        die("Missing required environment variables: " . $e->getMessage());
    }

    // Now use getenv() or $_ENV instead of define() for these variables
    define('DB_HOST', $_ENV['DB_HOST']);
    define('DB_USERNAME', $_ENV['DB_USERNAME']);
    define('DB_PASSWORD', $_ENV['DB_PASSWORD']);
    define('DB_NAME', $_ENV['DB_NAME']);
    define('BASE_URL', $_ENV['BASE_URL']);
    define('SITE_NAME', $_ENV['SITE_NAME'] ?? 'Kollege LMS');
    define('ADMIN_EMAIL', $_ENV['ADMIN_EMAIL'] ?? 'admin@example.com');
    define('ENVIRONMENT', $_ENV['ENVIRONMENT'] ?? 'production');
    // ... load other constants if needed ...
    ```
4.  **Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:** Create or edit the `.gitignore` file in the project root and add the line `.env` to prevent committing your secrets.

### Configuration (config.php Constants)

If you prefer not to use `.env` files:

1.  **Edit `config.php`:** Open the `config.php` file directly.
2.  **Update Constants:** Modify the `define()` statements for `DB_HOST`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`, and `BASE_URL` with your correct values.
    ```php
    define('DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
    define('DB_USERNAME', 'your_db_username');
    define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');
    define('DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
    define('BASE_URL', 'your_base_url_with_trailing_slash/');
    define('ENVIRONMENT', 'development'); // or 'production'
    ```
3.  **Security Risk:** Be extremely careful not to commit this file with real credentials to a public repository.

### Web Server Setup

  * **Document Root:** Configure your web server (Apache Virtual Host or Nginx Server Block) to point the document root to the project's **root directory** (the one containing `index.php`, `config.php`, etc.).
  * **URL Rewriting (Apache):** If using Apache and you want cleaner URLs (optional), ensure `mod_rewrite` is enabled. The provided `.htaccess` file should handle basic rewriting and security.
  * **URL Rewriting (Nginx):** You will need to add corresponding rules to your Nginx server block configuration. A common setup might look like this (adjust as needed):
    ```nginx
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name kollege.ct.ws;
        root /path/to/your/kollege-lms; # Path to project root

        index index.php index.html;

        location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
        }

        location ~ \.php$ {
            include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock; # Adjust PHP version/path
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
            include fastcgi_params;
        }

        # Deny access to hidden files and sensitive files
        location ~ /\. { deny all; }
        location ~* /(\.(env|config|log|sql)|README\.md|composer\.json)$ { deny all; }
    }
    ```

### Permissions

The web server process needs **write access** to the following directories:

  * `/public/uploads/` (and all its subdirectories: `notes`, `assignments`, `submissions`, `profile_images`, `certificates`)
  * `/logs/` (for the error handler)

You can typically set permissions using `chmod` and potentially `chown` on Linux-based systems. Consult your hosting provider's documentation or server administrator if unsure. A common starting point (use with caution):

```bash
chmod -R 755 /path/to/project
chmod -R 775 /path/to/project/public/uploads
chmod -R 775 /path/to/project/logs
# You might also need to change the group ownership if 'www-data' or similar is not the owner
# chown -R your_user:www-data /path/to/project
# chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/project/public/uploads
# chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/project/logs
```

-----

## Usage

1.  Navigate to the `BASE_URL` you configured in your web browser.
2.  You should see the Kollege LMS homepage.
3.  Use the "Login" or "Register" buttons.

### Default Credentials

If you imported the `seed_data.sql` file, you can use the following credentials:

  * **Admin:** `admin@kollege.ct.ws` / `password`
  * **Teacher:** `alan.smith@kollege.ct.ws` / `password`
  * **Student:** `alice@example.com` / `password`

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING:** Change these default passwords immediately after logging in for the first time\!

-----

## Key Implementation Considerations

### Security

  * **Database:** Uses PDO with prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
  * **Passwords:** Hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` (BCRYPT).
  * **Input:** All user input should be validated and sanitized (`htmlspecialchars` used for output, specific validation for inputs).
  * **Sessions:** Secure session handling practices are implemented (`session_regenerate_id`, HttpOnly cookies).
  * **File Uploads:** Validates file types and sizes; stores files with unique names. Consider storing outside the web root if possible (requires configuration changes).
  * **Access Control:** Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforced using session roles.
  * **CSRF Protection:** (Not explicitly added in generated files) Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing forms.
  * **Rate Limiting:** (Not explicitly added) Consider adding rate limiting for login attempts.
  * **Headers:** Basic security headers set via `.htaccess` (or Nginx config).

### Performance

  * **Database Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexes are created on frequently queried columns (e.g., foreign keys, email).
  * **Pagination:** Implement pagination for lists with potentially large numbers of records (e.g., users, logs, submissions).
  * **Caching:** (Not implemented) Consider caching frequently accessed, non-dynamic data.
  * **Asset Optimization:** Minify CSS and JavaScript files in a production environment. Optimize image sizes.

### User Experience (UX)

  * **Responsiveness:** Utilizes Bootstrap 5 for a mobile-first, responsive design.
  * **Feedback:** Provides clear success and error messages using flash sessions.
  * **Navigation:** Intuitive navigation structure for both public and authenticated areas.

### File Management

  * **Validation:** File types and sizes are checked before processing uploads.
  * **Storage:** Files are stored within `/public/uploads/` categorized by type.
  * **Naming:** Unique filenames are generated to prevent collisions and potential security issues.

-----

## API Endpoints Overview

The `/api/` directory contains endpoints used for AJAX requests, primarily returning JSON data. Key areas include:

  * `/api/users/`: Get user data, update profile, change password.
  * `/api/courses/`: Get course/subject lists, handle student enrollment.
  * `/api/assignments/`: Submit assignments, get submissions, grade submissions.
  * `/api/attendance/`: Mark attendance, get attendance records.
  * `/api/marks/`: Add/update marks, get marks records.
  * `/api/notes/`: Upload notes, delete notes.
  * `/api/messages/`: Send messages, get messages, mark as read.
  * `/api/notifications/`: Get notifications, mark as read.
  * `/api/search.php`: Global search functionality.

*(Refer to individual files in `/api/` for specific parameters and expected behavior.)*

-----

## Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

  * Implement robust CSRF protection on all forms.
  * Add email verification workflow.
  * Implement pagination for all long lists.
  * Develop more detailed reporting and analytics features.
  * Add a richer text editor for announcements and descriptions.
  * Implement real-time notifications (e.g., using WebSockets).
  * Refactor to a more formal MVC pattern or use a lightweight framework.
  * Add unit and integration tests.
  * Implement certificate generation feature.
  * Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
